# iOS Sixt Test

Two pods were used on the project

1. **TRON**: For networking & response parsing. Built on top of Alamofire and SwiftyJSON.
2. **Kingfisher**: For setting images directly from a URL.


Remember to do pod install if you wish to run the project.

The functionality is very basic and the networking and error handling could be dramatically improved.
However, I believed that to be outside the scope of the test.
